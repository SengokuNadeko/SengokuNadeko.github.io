                    <h1>First Blog Post</h1>
                    <p>May 25th, 2023</p>
                    <p>Hey everyone! Welcome to my website. It's all still a W.I.P but changes are rapidly coming. In these blogs, I will update everyone on progress on my projects, show some gameplay videos, etc. </p>
                    <p>I have a basic roadmap for upcoming projects. Right now, there are three projects I am working on alongside this website:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A Pirate Game.</li>
                        <li>A RPG Maker Game.</li>
                        <li>Project Sun.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>A Pirate Game</h2>
                    <p>"A Pirate Game" is a game that is currently being made in the Unity engine. It's going to be a fairly large passion project. Admittedly, it's just going to be a One Piece rip off game, however, it's going to have some twists to it. The main goal for this project is to create a full on RPG experience with an engaging story and world. Currently it's still in the earliest stages of development. This project is also a priority for me compared to the others listed. Please look forward to it!</p>
                    <h2>A RPG Maker Game</h2>
                    <p>This is also in its earliest stages of development. This is just going to be a small project as I learn the RPG Maker MV engine. I will provide some updates about this as they come!</p>
                    <h2>Project Sun</h2>
                    <p>"Project Sun" is a dream game me and a friend are working on. This is a long-term project that is in it's earliest stages of development. Not much will be revealed about it at this moment, however it will also be the first full-scale Unity indie game I'll make. Please look forward to this one as well.</p>
                    <P>That's all for now, I think. I'll add more blog entries with updates! Thanks for reading and if you have any feedback, feel free to reach out.</P>
